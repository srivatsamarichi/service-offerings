# App Modernization with Azure Kubernetes Service

Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration platform for automating the management, scaling and routing of containers. This platform provides necessary capabilities for container orchestration without the steep learning curve, simplified security configuration and simplified infrastructure.

## Overview

Canarys helps you achieve higher productivity, with cost effective solutions, reduced maintenance and better information flow leveraging Microsoft Azure Platform.

Microsoft Azure offers wide spectrum of Services under Infrastructure, Platform & Software which are commonly known as IaaS, PaaS & SaaS.

Sudden and compelling demands of Infrastructure is one of the key areas of industry which historically proven to be expensive and time consuming. Getting it done right the first time is highly critical to avoid costly failure.
